The first was obtain an API key to consume the resurces from http://developer.marvel.
Later i consumed the resource from https://gateway.marvel.com:443/v1/public/comics?title=Cable%20%26%20deadpool&issueNumber=46&apikey=c3773e9d5f6fbf3b3edbd60226be1df9, where i obtained the ID of Cable & Deadpool (2004) #46 (Zombie Variant)
With this ID then, i could search at endpoint https://gateway.marvel.com:443/v1/public/comics/21845/characters?apikey=c3773e9d5f6fbf3b3edbd60226be1df9 where it returned to me the list of all characters from this specific commic with a little description of them.

For the second part, i searched Agent X (Nijo) id and with this i could find all stories where he appears.
